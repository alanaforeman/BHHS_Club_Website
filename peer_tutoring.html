							<h1>Peer Tutoring Club</h1>
							
							<p>Peer Tutor is a volunteer club for students to work with other students on their academics. Typically, upperclassmen whom have excelled in an earlier class will work with underclassmen once or twice a week. This help can be weekly or just prior to examinations. Itâ€™s a way to connect students with one another as well.</p>
							<p>We are looking for juniors and seniors who have performed well in their earlier classes. We will align you with a younger student to not only help but to also serve as a Big Brother/Big Sister to them. There is a spreadsheet that lists what subject each Peer Tutor specializes in, and once they have a tutoree, the appointments will be scheduled between the two students.</p>
							<p>All meetings take place virtually between club members and tutoring sessions are set up independently. Students and their assigned tutors can meet in person provided they follow Covid Protocols. </p>
              <p>If you are interested in joining the club as a sophomore, please see Mr. Allen (Room 411/ <a href = "mailto: mallen@byramhills.net"> mallen@byramhills.net)</a> or Alyssa Margolin <a href = "mailto: margolina22@byramhills.net"> (margolina22@byramhills.net)</a>. </p>
