To add a club page, please duplicate the generic.html file and rename. Edit club information under the "main" comment where there is generic text, and add any media. Include a description of the club, meeting location/dates/times, a Google Classrom code, and the name/email of the advisor/president(s) to contact. 

Be sure to add a tile for the club's page on the homepage (index.html) and any subpage by copying the format of the article tag (tile section). Be sure to change the link here to the corresponding html file.
