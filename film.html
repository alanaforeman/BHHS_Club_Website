							<h1>The Film Club</h1>
							
							<p>Open to all students at any level & interest, the Film Club provides an opportunity for students to be part of something fun, creative, and in a friendly environment. It's the perfect way to enjoy quality screen time from the comfort of your sofa; monthly topics include short film screenings, director Q&As,  interviews,  technical demonstrations, and lively discussions about movies we've seen and loved! This year, our monthly meetings are at 7 PM  â€¢  9/28, 10/9, 11/16, 12/14, 1/25, 2/8, 3/15, 4/5, 5/10
							</p>
							<p>If you are interested in watching movies and learning how to create them, attend a meeting of the Film Club at Byram. With this club, you can explore your interest  in the film industry, such as:
								<ul>
									<li>Writing</li>
									<li>Directing</li>
									<li>Producing</li>
									<li>Acting</li>
									<li>Film editing</li>
								</ul> 
							</p>
							<p>The goals of the Film Club are to:
								<ol>
									<li>Provide students with the opportunity to develop writing, producing, filming, and editing interests through discussions with current industry filmmakers.
									</li>
									<li>Provide students interested in careers in broadcasting, film production, and journalism the opportunity to participate in discussions that can promote the necessary skills required to make and enjoy movies.
									</li>
									<li>Provide students (post-covid) an opportunity to collaborate on a film project. When permitted, students work together during one fantastic weekend to create a movie - start to finish - together. This film is then submitted to online and student film festivals.
									</li>
								</ol> 
							</p>
							<p>The Byram Film Club is an excellent opportunity for students to watch movies together and discuss them with other film lovers their age. You don't have to be a seasoned cinephile to participate! We all approach cinema from different places and all points of view are welcome.
