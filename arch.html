							<h1>Arch (Yearbook)</h1>
							
							<p>The Arch has the unique and important task of creating an accurate, interesting, and engaging book that records an entire school year. Its staff carefully crafts a book that students can reflect on and cherish in the years to come.</p>
							<p>Being a member of the Arch staff is extremely rewarding. Students learn to think and write like a journalist, edit thoughtfully, and design spread layouts. Photography and other graphics are also integral to making the final product come alive. No previous experience is required and all new members receive training. </p>
							<p>In addition to the above-mentioned benefits, perks of being on the Yearbook include accessing certain school functions with official press passes, obtaining very stylish Arch sweatshirts, and attending the Columbia Scholastic Press Association Convention.</p>
              <p>Notably, members have creative freedom. The writing format is not strictly enforced and students can experiment with different angles and styles. Joining the Yearbook is the perfect way to strengthen the skills you already have and to dabble in new ones. </p>
              <p>The Arch Yearbook meets in the Graphic Design Studio, room 419, at 2:30 every Thursday.</p>
              <p>If you are curious, you can peruse past years’ books in the school library or make an appointment with Ms. Menasche to visit the Yearbook’s office and archives.</p>
