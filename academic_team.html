							<h1>Academic Team</h1>
							
							<p>Academic Challenge is a trivia club where two teams of four students compete in a head to head team trivia 
								competition with a wide variety of questions ranging anywhere from roman emperors to rock music. Because 
								there are so many different categories, everyone has something to contribute and a specific niche to fill. 
								During practices, we do a practice round using questions from past tournaments.  We emphasize building teamwork 
								and collaboration skills; skills which are instrumental in Academic challenge as well all areas of life. 
								The structure of the rounds is modeled around the idea of teamwork, with discussion being allowed during all parts. 
								The rounds are divided into four quarters, with three quarters including tossup questions and one being a 70 second 
								lightning round. Our club is also among the most successful in the school, with two national championship wins in 
								2008 and 2020. We hope to keep this success going strong in the years to come. Asking anyone from previous years, 
								they will tell you that Academic Challenge was one of the highlights of high school, and they developed a multitude 
								of valuable life skills during their experiences in the club.
							</p>
							
							<p>Our club meets <b>Tuesday and Thursday</b> from 3:15 to 4:15. We will be having one virtual and one live practice a week. Live practices will be held in Mr. Gilbert's room.
							</p>
