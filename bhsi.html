							<h1>Byram Hills Sustainability Initiative</h1>
							<p>The Byram Hills Sustainability Initiative (BHSI) provides a path for students to get involved in making positive environmental change in our school. Over the past few years, BHSI is responsible for the installation of water bottle refilling stations, banning plastic straws at The Bean, pop tab collections to raise funds for the Ronald McDonald House and diverting hundreds of household batteries and lightbulbs from entering landfills, among others.  Beyond local initiatives, the BHSI also provides members with opportunities to connect to environmental change on a larger scale. On September 20, 2019, members of the club attended the Climate Strike at Foley Square where Greta Thunberg spoke.  In March 2020, we were scheduled to participate in the Youth Climate Action Leadership Summit in White Plains.    
							</p>
							<p>The club operates through an initiative based approach where students identify an area of need, collaborate with team members to develop an action plan, then implement the plan.  This means that members can come with their own ideas and form a group to implement them, or they can join an initiative that caters to their skills and interests. </p>
							<p>Additionally, BHSI welcomes any and all new members. Any skills or passions can be exercised within the field of environmentalism, and participation in our club is a great way to use your skills for the betterment of the environment and our school. 
							</p>
							<p>You dont have to be a self proclaimed environmentalist to join our club.  We are recruiting members interested in setting up and managing our social media; who enjoy writing emails, announcements, Focus blurbs, and articles; graphic designers and artists, and those looking to put their marketing skills to the test, just to name a few. If you have a passion or skill that you would like to hone through participation in our club, we welcome you with open arms!
							</p>
							<p>We meet Wednesdays at 2:30PM in the Administrative Conference Room!
