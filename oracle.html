							<h1>The Oracle</h1>
							<p>The Oracle is Byram Hills’ school newspaper. Joining The Oracle is an excellent opportunity to hone different writing, editing, and design skills, as well as to learn about and experiment with journalistic writing. We cover school, local, national, and global news. You can write a review of your latest Netflix binge, a scathing OpEd, an eye-opening letter-to-the-editor, or a profile on your favorite teacher, to name a few options. In addition, to celebrate The Oracle throughout the year, we host speaker events periodically, where you can hear from some of your favorite authors or experts in the field.
							</p>
							<p>No previous journalistic experience is required, and all new writers are trained. Topics are assigned during a period of “topic selection,” but there is substantial wiggle room and creative freedom. In short, we can assign you a topic, or you can write about whatever you’d like. We operate on a schedule of writing “cycles.” You are welcome to write as much as you want, and you are able to take a cycle off if needed. Through Google Classroom, your piece will be edited by one of our upperclassmen editors, who will provide thoughtful feedback and reflection on your work to help you grow as a reporter.
							</p>
							<p>In the end, The Oracle is an open forum for sharing stories that matter. We hope you will join The Oracle family.
							</p>
							<p>The Oracle meets right after school (@ 2:30) once per month (usually on a Monday) in Mrs. Eshoo’s room (room 323).
