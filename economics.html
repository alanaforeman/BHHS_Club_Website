							<h1>Economics Club</h1>
							<p>The Economics club is a group of likeminded, curious, and absolute alpha people all with one interest in common: Economics. Economics is a very broad term relating to so many different topics, the beauty of this club is we talk about all of them. This is not a class, there is no teacher, everyone in this club brings their own knowledge and curiosity. We gather weekly to talk about different topics(real estate, stock market, bonds, forex, anything else you're interested in) and we teach and learn from each other. The economics club thrives on a collection of ideas, insights, and questions posed by its members. Input from members drives our discussions (there are no bad questions here), so we can learn more as a group. Throughout the year we conduct activities like stock market simulators to coincide with what we learn. We also bring in experienced guest speakers who are in the financial world, in order to better understand what the business path would look like in college and into the workplace. Furthermore, the economics club competes in DECA which puts your economic knowledge to the test at the regional, state, and national level. We Hope To See You There!!
