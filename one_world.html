							<h1>One World Club</h1>
							
							<p>The One World Club is a group of Byram Hills students devoted to bringing about positive change on both a local and global scale. We accomplish this objective by organizing community events to raise funds and subsequently donating the proceeds to good causes. 
							</p>
							<p>We hold an annual Benefit Concert, traditionally partnering with the Youth Against Cancer club. This talent show-like event brings students and teachers together, promoting both community building and philanthropic efforts. We host a range of events, such as bake sales in the cafeteria, Mother’s Day Plant sales, and school-wide car washes. One event that is typically a highlight of club members’ experience is cooking brunch for the Ronald McDonald House.
							</p>
							<p>In partnership with Mr. Ken Kaplan, our most recent fundraising endeavors went toward purchasing technology, such as Raspberry Pi computers and projectors, for the Facing the Future School in Kibera, Africa’s largest urban slum. This had a direct impact on the education of students in a school lacking resources.
							</p>
							<p>Ultimately, the One World Club is dedicated to being proactive and striving to make a positive difference through projects both big and small.
							</p>
							<p>The One World Club meets once per month (usually on a Tuesday) from 2:30-3:00pm in Mr. Horowitz’s room (room 313).
							</p>
